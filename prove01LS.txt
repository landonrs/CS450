1. Please provide the URL of your public GitHub repository.



For questions 2-6, please type "True" or "False" in front of the question number.

2. My experiment shell can correctly load the Iris dataset:

3. My experiment shell randomizes the order of the instances (making sure to keep instances lined up with their appropriate targets) it and splits the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%)?

4. I have created a HardCoded classifier class with two methods: train and predict. The train method accepts training data (including targets). The predict method returns a prediction or classification for each instance it receives.

5. The Experiment Shell, processes the data, passes the training data to the classifierâ€™s train method, the test data to the predict method, and then compares the predicted values against the correct answers, to produce an overall accuracy (on the test set).

6. I have run the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and obtained a result.

7. What accuracy do you get when running the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and why do you think that is?
